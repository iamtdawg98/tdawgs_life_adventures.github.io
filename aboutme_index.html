  <h2 class="header-two">About Me and My Computer Science Story! :)</h2>
  <h3 class="header-three">A Little About Me :) </h3>
  <p class="words"> Hi, my name is Tony (but I also go by the name of Tony Bolongna or Tony the Tiger or His Majesty, the Imperial Overlord T Dawg) and I am a little baby first year at the University of Virginia (although my first year will actually be over in just over a month which is a scary thought). I am using this website as practice to learn how to code and make fancy websites in Javascript, CSS, and HTML (currently we are only in the HTML phase and are slowly moving to the CSS phase but the rest will come in time!!) As we travel down through the webpage on this wonderous adventure, you shall learn about my coding experience as well as my dreams and ambitions! But for now here is a little about me! As I have already said, I am a student at the University of Virginia and am a brand new CS major. As far as clubs, I am in Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship (shout out to all of my Chi Alphans out there!) and Cavalier Symphony Orchestra. My soul animals consist of the giraffe (because like the giraffe, I am tall and awkward) and the flamingo (because I am tall and eccentric). I am an extreme cat person and am basically a cat myself (i.e. I sleep all day, I love laying on the floor, and mildly don't like being around large amounts of people). Speaking of cats enjoy this complimentary picture of my cat, George:</p>
  <img id="George" src="IMG_1497.jpg"/>
  <p class="words">George is pretty robust cat and he is pretty lazy (the cat lays down when he is playing...). Although he is lazy and does not always like moving or snuggling he is still an awesome cat and I miss being able to see him everyday (Summer break here I come!). Speaking of my obsessions with cats, you should check out this app that I got on the Google Chrome store called Tabby Cat! Everytime you open up a new tab, it pulls up a random cat with the most adorable name ever and it makes me so happy :D :D and I think that it is a necessity for everyone to have!</p>

  <p class="words">Anywho, back to me, I am the youngest of three (I have two older sisters) and I live in Richmond, Virginia for 33% of the year at home and at school in Charlottesville, Virginia for the other 66% of the year (I know, I know that is only 99% of my life but don't question where I am the other 1% of the time! It is top secret!!!!) I also have played piano for 11 years. I play a few other instruments but piano is my number one and favorite instrument of all of them (probably followed up by viola). Another super important thing about me is that I love coffee with a burning passion. Ya boi can make starbucks quality beverages. I make a pretty mean Caramel Macchiato and that is only the beginning of my amazing coffee making skills. Anywho, introductions aside, let us go on a journey through my CS adventures, goals, and expectations (being that CS is kind of what I want to do with my life)! Hold on for a wild ride! (jk this has been a pretty wild ride already, so prepare for another wild ride!)</p>
  
  <h3 class="header-three">Why Did I Choose Coding?</h3>
  <p class="words"> For a long time, I have been extremely fascinated by video games and the power that they are able to command with their deeply entwining stories and the emotional effect they are able to have on people. Throughout my time in highschool and even to this day, the gaming community on YouTube is one that I actively watch and love being a part of. It never really crossed my mind that making them would be fun, and even when I was little I would think to myself "I don't even feel like that is a real job." The real moment I realized I was destined to become a Computer Science major was during a family movie night sometime when I was in high school. We watched a movie titled the Internship, where the two main characters end up becoming interns at Google. Instantly I fell in love with the idea of coding and was very captivated by the challenges they were presented. Coming out of that movie, I knew in my heart that I was destined to be a CS major and now that I have begun to learn coding, my decision has been strengthened 100%</p>
  
  <h3 class="header-three"> My Humble Beginnings in Python </h3>
  <a href="https://www.python.org/about/" target=_"blank">
    <img id="snek" src="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/animals/thumbs/rights-exempt/reptiles/b/burmese-python_thumb.jpg"/></a>
  <p class="words">Python was the first programming language that I was introduced to and that is in the class I am currently enrolled in through the University of Virginia's Computer Science Department, housed in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The class I am in (CS1110: Introduction to Programming) covers the basic concepts of coding and programming languages as well as allowing us to learn these concepts through hands on assignments that are coded in the Python language. We are often given problems for homework or in our lab section and have to code them in Python which is always a blast trying to problem solve and debug your code when it is not operating as it should. On top of classwork, I often like to look up fun coding projects online or make up projects on my own that I would like to try  to accomplish in order for me to gain useful experience and become more familiar with a vast array of programming concepts and ideas. If you are unfamiliar with Python or would just like more information, boop the snake up there on the nose! Also if you want to learn more about CS1110 at UVa, click the link below! </p>

  <h3 class="header-three"> The Rise of HTML and CSS</h3>
  <p class="words">After learning Python, I became desirous of learning more programming languages. After talking to my fellow engineering Chi Alphan friend, Renee, I learned of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Late one night, in the depths of Alderman Library I began to learn coding in HTML and thus this website was born! I picked up HTML pretty quickly because there is relatively little coding involved and it is mostly text syntax. Similarly, I have gained some basic understandings of CSS in order to better format and make my HTML documents prettier. Both are fairly simple in terms of actually coding and if I can not figure something out I am usually able to find a quick fix in a matter of seconds. I am proud of myself to say that I have a fairly formatted (albeit a very simple website with not much content) in just a few days, coming from no prior experience in either HTML or CSS. From here there are many coding languages I would like to learn such as:</p>
  <ul class="words">
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>SASS</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 class="header-three"> What Are My Ultimate Goals and Ambitions in Terms of Coding!?</h3>
  <p class="words"> By the time I come out of UVa's CS program I hope to have gained proficient CS experience and coding skills and will be able to make some pretty awesome websites, applications, and video games! I also plan to learn cyber security which I think I could be pretty cool and fascinating! Also hopefully I can learn to problem solve and stuff on computers because I run into computer problems quite often!</p>
  <img id="pc-pic" src="https://origincdn.azureedge.net/cdn/v3/img/callouts/2015/workstations.png"/>
  <p class="words"> After I graduate from UVa, I hope to use my BS in CS (lol I still think that is a 10/10 degree name) to go into the game development industry! Video gaming is an underappreciated art form and I have always felt that they can be an extremely impactful story telling medium due to players actually becoming the character as opposed to books and movies where the one enjoying the art form is simply watching from the outside. It is my life dream and ambition to become part of a development team that can bring these miraculous stories to life and even cause change in the world. Which gaming studio I might work at you may ask? That I have no clue! (Probs not EA because I mildly view them as trash pandas haha rip) Anywho we shall see what God's plan for me is and just fake it till I make it! Thank you for joining me on this wild journey and we shall see what comes from this webpage as I become better in my coding skills and abilites! Good times, go Hoos!</p>
