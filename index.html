  <h1 class="header-two"> Welcome to TDawg's Life Adventures!</h1>
  <p class="words" id="page-length">  This site is extremely unfinished so please pardon our dust as we work on getting everything active and live! You may come across pages that are unfinished or functions that are yet to be implemented. Please bear with us as we work to get everything up and running! Just make sure to keep in mind that the development team for the site currently consists of one mildly unexperienced computer science major who is teaching himself things. In the coming week we are hopefully going to work on finishing the pages that we currently have operational (this will mainly be formatting them in such a way that looks much nicer than our current set up). We will hopefully also be able to launch a more appealing Home page to the site but for now we wanted to publicly release all the hard work that has been contributed thus far to the project! Once again, thank you for your support and patience as we deligently work to have the website fully operational and make sure to check back periodically to see when functions are added!</p>
