    <h3 class="system-info-subtitle">Latest Version</h3>
    <p class="words">Pre-alpha 2.0 -- 4/2/2017 Version pre-alpha 2.0 contains many significant upgrades over the prior iterations of the websites. In version 2.0, a much more user friendly interface was layed out including breaking the site up into several interconnected webpages as opposed to everything being on one central webpage. The incorporation of several bootstrap elements (such as the navigation bar) allows for a much better and more aesthetically pleasing design. More work is also done in the CSS coding to make a generally nicer looking web design without tacky or clashing styles. Version pre-alpha 2.0 will be released to the public on GitHub Pages and will most likely be the operating version of the site for a while as we look into working on potential future updates and start other projects. Please bear with us until we are able to further polish the site and initialize more features. Thank you for your patience!
    <h3 class="system-info-subtitle">Version History</h3>
    <p class="words">Pre-alpha 1.1 -- 3/30/2017: In version pre-alpha 1.1, more formatting and cleaning up of the site has occured. All text entries have been edited and formatted for a more professional and mildly (but not really) useful appearance. Several text entries have been added to make it more of a cohesive read and allow for user to understand better. The website is also recieving more of a make over with some CSS coding in order to make it more aesthetically pleasing. Lastly version pre-alpha 1.1 also contains information on most recent version of the site and things that have changed since the last release of the code. With this, there is also a list of previous versions of the site that have been created in order to show its progression since first written. Version pre-alpha 1.1 was not publicly rleleased.</p>
    <p class="words" id="page-length">Pre-alpha 1.0 -- 3/28/2017: In version pre-alpha 1.0, basic formatting of the website was done in html. It was more or less just Tony ranting about Tony as he often does. There were extreme levels of sass contained within and all text contained was uneditted. This version was a very rough design made primarily to get the website up and running so that intensive editting could be done on it. Version pre-alpha 1.0 was not publicly released.</p>
